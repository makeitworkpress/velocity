Repository for the Velocity WordPress Theme

# velocity
Velocity is a light-weight WordPress theme created for extreme performance, capable of loading around 200ms. It is crafted for blogging and online portfolios and features pages, posts and projects. 

It uses a minimum of dependencies. For example, it does not require jQuery on the front-end. Because Velocity incorporates custom post types, it is unfortunately not available on the public WordPress theme repository.

A live website using the Velocity WordPress theme can be found [here](https://michieltramper.com). This is the theme authors personal blog and portfolio.
